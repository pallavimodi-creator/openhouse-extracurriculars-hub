/**
 * Vocabulary cards data — flippable Mrs-Wordsmith-style cards for the
 * Language Through Storytelling 3–5 programme.
 *
 * Each card is a single word pulled from one of the 5 picture books we
 * have scene assets for. The scene image is the moment in the book
 * where the word is encountered; the rest is educator-facing pedagogy.
 *
 * Modes — five ways a 3–5 year old can play the word:
 *  - emote        : show the word as a face / feeling
 *  - enact        : do the word with the body
 *  - sentence     : say the word inside a tiny sentence
 *  - word-pairs   : pair it with a friend (synonym) and an opposite (antonym)
 *  - what-why-how : open question for describing words
 *
 * Each card declares which modes are most natural for its word; the UI
 * still shows all five so the educator can choose, but the natural ones
 * are highlighted.
