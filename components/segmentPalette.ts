/**
 * Segment palette — single source of truth for segment-coloured surfaces.
 *
 * Every overview, day plan, library card, and segment popup that needs to
 * tint a surface by segment should call segmentPalette(segmentId) and read
 * from the returned tonal pack. No more hex literals, no more random
 * Tailwind palette utilities (bg-violet-200 / text-amber-900 / etc).
 *
 * Mapping uses the brand colours defined in tailwind.config.ts under
 * colors.segment.* — same hex values as the original category-* tokens
 * but named by the segment role they play across all programmes.
 *
 *   yellow → art-gym · roll-call · experiment
 *   green  → art-games · playground · build
 *   blue   → artiverse · artistotle · showtime
 *   pink   → log-book · experience-book
 *   orange → art-care · accents
 *
 * The same segment id can mean different things across programmes (e.g.
 * "experiment" only exists in robotics) — but the tone we paint it stays
 * consistent so a teacher can read the page without learning new colours.
