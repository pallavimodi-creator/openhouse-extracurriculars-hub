              Children explore curated artworks, learn through the right mediums and techniques, and draw inspiration from artists and illustrators known for deeply understanding children&apos;s art and imagination.

            </p>
            <p>
              This is a holistic language programme that builds all core skills —{" "}
              <span className="font-semibold text-ink">listening, speaking, reading, and early writing</span> — through the formats that children learn best from: books, songs, games, and playful practice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every part of the programme is rooted in context. Children don&apos;t learn words in isolation — they meet them in stories, use them in conversation, revisit them through games, and gradually make them their own. Our writing work is also meaning-driven, with children expressing ideas from stories through drawing, mark-making, and early writing.
            </p>
            <p className="rounded-xl bg-brand-white p-3 ring-1 ring-ink/10">
              This is an{" "}
              <span className="font-semibold text-ink">emergent literacy programme</span>. Children first understand what reading is — how books work, how print carries meaning, and how language flows — before learning to decode it.
            </p>
            <p>
              We intentionally do not begin with phonics or alphabet-led reading at this stage. At ages 3–5, children learn language best through rich exposure, repetition, and meaningful use. This approach builds strong vocabulary, confident expression, and a deep connection to books — forming the foundation for formal reading and writing that follows.
            </p>
            <p>
              Across sessions, stories act as the anchor. Words, ideas, and expressions are encountered again and again, until they are{" "}
