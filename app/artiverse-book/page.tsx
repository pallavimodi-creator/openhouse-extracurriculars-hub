/**
 * Artiverse book — a digital flipbook of all 12 Artiverse projects in the
 * Art & Design 3-5 programme. Pairs (Circles, Finger Painting, Sponge, Blow
 * & Splatter) include their day-2 spreads as separate pages so the teacher
 * can see both reference images. Each page is captioned with its chapter
 * + project + a one-line build description so the book reads like a real
 * book — image and text together.
